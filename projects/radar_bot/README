Cleaning this project for a fresh compilation:

- cd build
- make clean
- cd ..
- bob_make

Running this project in conjunction with the radar AWR1642 from Texas Instruments:

a. The radar needs to be flashed using uniflash and the corresponding binaries to stream data via the serial interface
	+ Follow the flashing steps here in uniflash:
		/bob_robotics/resources/radar_dsp_code
b. Once the radar is flashed, we execute the following:

- sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0 // Granting access to the serial ports
- sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM1 // Granting access to the serial ports
- python3 UART_transmit.py    // A virtual environment is available in bob_robotics/examples/radar
			      // It is useful to press the nRST button on the radar to refresh its attention to the transmit script
			      // Once the script closes successfully with all the commands being received by the radar the sensor is ready to send the serial data

- ./simulator		      // The simulator will execute the obstacle avoidance demo. 
			      // Inside simulator, there is a serial interface implemented in radar.h, which pulls the serial data out from the radar

c. You can close the simulator and simply reopen it without re-flashing or re-configuring the serial transmission again. Just type again:

- ./simulator
