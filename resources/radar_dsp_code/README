// Code for flashing the AWR1642-ODS radar to 
// configure the serial data interface. This is
// used in the following items:
// 1. bob_robotics/examples/radar
// 2. bob_robotics/projects/radar_bot

This code is to be compiled in Windows, using
Code Composer Studio (CCS). However, you are only
required to compile it if you want to extend the
DSP functionality on the radar. Otherwise, the
binaries are pre-built here for you to just flash
the radar using uniflash

--------------------------------------------------
Compiling the Code Composer Studio code 8.2.0:

Again, these steps are only needed if you want to
extend the radar functionality:

1. The compilation should occur in two steps:

	* First the DSS folder, which contains the
	  DSP code
		+ ods_16xx_dss
		 	- Rebuild project

	* Second the MSS folder, which contains the
	  soft core code
		+ ods_16xx_mss
			- Rebuild project

2. There could be an error on the compilation in Windows,
   which is associated to the delete binaries command:
		+ Right click on each project:
			properties->Build->Steps
		+ And change the rm -f based command
		  for these ones:
			del /f /q
		+ Then Rebuild project in the same
		  order DSS -> MSS


--------------------------------------------------
Flashing the radar using Uniflash:

0. Set the jumpers on the AWR1642-ODS in the programming 
   mode:
	* SOP2: Black jumper closing the two contacts
	* SOP1: Black jumper open
	* SOP0: Black jumper closing the two contacts
1. Open uniflash with the microUSB cable connected
   to the radar.
2. Select the device you want to flash:
   - In our case it is: AWR1642-ODS
3. Go to the Settings & Utilities tab to set the 
   COM port.
   - The COM port number can be seen in the Device
     Manager in front of the User UART line:
	* XDS110 Class Application/User UART (COM38)
	* XDS110 Class Auxiliary Data Port (COM39)
     In this case it would be COM38
4. Go to the Program tab and click on Browse in front of
   Meta Image 1:
	* Select the binary you want to flash:
	  + This is the file you want to use for flashing
            the radar:
   		ods_16xx_mss/Debug/xwr16xx_ods_ti_design_lab.bin
	* Then click on Load Image

5. After flashing, we change the jumpers from the programming
   mode to the execution mode:
	* SOP2: Black jumper open
	* SOP1: Black jumper open
	* SOP0: Black jumper closing the two contacts
6. Press the nRST button and then 
   disconnect the microUSB cable for connecting it to the 
   Jetson NVIDIA board
	* Then we can proceed with the UART_transmit.py
	  inside the corresponding example you want to run:
		+ bob_robotics/examples/radar
		+ bob_robotics/projects/radar_bot
